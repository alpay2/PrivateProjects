# PrivateProjects
Hello, my name is Aytekin Alpay, and I am a student at The Ohio State University studying Computer Science and Engineering.
I enjoy doing private projects by myself to better my skills, and combine my other interests with coding.
This repository showcases my projects I do on my free time.

The projects that are available currently are:

1- POS.java: A standard retail register system

2- MarvelCinematicUniverseEncyclopedia.java: An encyclopeida of MCU heroes with their affiliated groups

3- ChampionsLeague.java: An interactive simulator of the UEFA Champions League, with settings to be custom made or associated with the 2018/19 Champions League

4- NBA_Playoffs: An interactive simulator of the NBA Playoffs

5- PlayByPlay: A user friendly play by play generator

Hope you enjoy!
