# PrivateProjects
Hello, my name is Aytekin Alpay, and I am a student at The Ohio State University studying Computer Science and Engineering.
I enjoy doing private projects by myself to better my skills, and combine my other interests with coding.
This repository showcases my projects I do on my free time.
Hope you enjoy!
